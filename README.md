# Queue Management System
### About
This project is originated from a [term project](https://suoglu.github.io/misc/other/Term_Project_Fall_2015-2016+v.1.pdf) and rewrote with [Xilinx Vivado](http://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html) to work on [Digilent Basys 3](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/basys-3/reference-manual).

This project provides a queue management system with two tellers. Each teller has 12bit passcode entered with right most 12 switches. Initial value for passcodes is 0. Tellers can change their passcode when the bank is open using passcode switch (3rd switch from left). While passcode switch is on, teller that wants to change his/her passcode enters old passcode and pushes his/her button. Later enters new passcode and pushes his/her button. To cancel this process teller can turn passcode switch off.
