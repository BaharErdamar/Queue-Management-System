# Queue Management System
### About
This project is originated from a [term project](https://suoglu.github.io/misc/other/Term_Project_Fall_2015-2016+v.1.pdf) and rewrote with [Xilinx Vivado](http://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html) to work on [Digilent Basys 3](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/basys-3/reference-manual).

* **System description**
This project provides a queue management system with two tellers. Each teller has 12bit passcode entered with right most 12 switches. Initial value for passcodes is 0. Tellers can change their passcode when the bank is open using passcode switch (3rd switch from left). While passcode switch is on, teller that wants to change his/her passcode enters old passcode and pushes his/her button. Later enters new passcode and pushes his/her button. To cancel this process teller can turn passcode switch off. Tellers can open and close their counter using counter switch (2rd switch from left) while bank is open. Teller that wants to open/close his/her counter enters his/her passcode and pushes his/her button. To open/close bank, bank switch (left most switch) turn on, tellers enters their passcodes and pushes their buttons one after other.
